title:  "Thanks for those 100 stars!"

I'm glad that you guys have liked and supported the theme to reach 100 stars on Github. I would like to thank everyone who has supported the theme by using, starring and using it for their websites.

Themes get better when people contribute. That is how our [Online CV](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv){: target="_blank"} got more than 250 likes. I would like to ask users to suggest changes and if possible create a pull-request.
